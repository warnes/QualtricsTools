#' Get Restructured Questions (with inserted Responses)
#' and Blocks (with inserted Questions) from data
#' provided by Qualtrics.
#'
#' This function returns a list with two elements, where
#' the first element is questions with their responses
#' and results-tables listed in them, and secondly
#' the blocks of the survey, with questions listed in
#' each block as BlockElements.
#' @param survey A qualtrics survey list object,
#' uploaded from a Qualtrics Survey File (QSF). Use
#' ask_for_qsf() to create such a survey list object from a QSF file.
#' @param responses A dataframe of Qualtrics responses to a survey.
#' Use ask_for_csv() to create such a dataframe from a CSV file.
#' @param original_first_rows A dataframe contianing the header information
#' for each column of response data. This dataframe includes a row for the DataExportTag based
#' response column names, another for the Question Text stem and choice text (although
#' truncated), and a row with QID based column names.
#' @return A list with two elements: the questions,
#' and the survey blocks. All questions in the trash are
#' excluded, HTML and CSS are removed from question text,
#' responses, notes, and a more easily human readable question
#' type are inserted into each question. The blocks then have
#' their BlockElements replaced by corresponding questions
#' where applicable. The BlockElements of the list of Blocks
#' from a survey originally only refer to questions
#' by their DataExportTag. However, this is inconvenient
#' because it adds an additional lookup step, and so they are
#' replaced by the real objects here. Questions is a named list for which names
#' are data export tags. Blocks containing questions have Block Elements for these
#' questions named with the Data Export Tags.

#' Link Responses to Questions
#'
#' The columns of the response data must be matched up to their corresponding
#' questions and question-parts in order to analyze them. One of two methods is employed, depending
#' on whether or not the original_first_rows are from Insights or Legacy data.
#'
#' If Insights data is used, each question is looped through and the QuestionIDs are used to
#' match response columns to a question.
#'
#' Otherwise, a much more complicated process is used:
#' each question is looped through, determining the DataExportTag of the question,
#' and the ChoiceDataExportTags of the question. The DataExportTag might look
#' like a variable name that has been set by the user in Qualtrics, or an
#' automatically generated name like "QID1" or "QID1.1". The columns
#' with names automatically generated by Qualtrics usually are of a form
#' starting with the DataExportTag, followed by an underscore, and then more details.
#' Sometimes they are exactly the DataExportTag without any modification. Lastly,
#' if the user sets their own variable naming in Qualtrics, then the question
#' contains in its [['Payload']] the [['ChoiceDataExportTags']] list, which contains
#' these user defined variables. This function goes through each question,
#' determines the DataExportTag and ChoiceDataExportTags, and uses each to select
#' the matching columns of the responses. Those are then inserted into that specific
#' question under [['Responses']], and the whole questions list is returned. One small
#' caveat is that if the column name starts with an integer, then R
#' will prepend it with an "X", so there is a helper function included here to include
#' those columns with prepended "X"s as well.
#'
#' @param questions A list of questions selected from a Qualtrics survey
#' @param responses A data frame of responses from a Qualtrics survey
#' @param original_first_rows The original header rows to the CSV response set
#'
#' @return The updated list of questions, each including its relevant response columns
#' as a data frame stored in [['Responses']].

#' columns are listed along with the data export tag of the question they correspond

#' of question types!), and the response type.

#' automatically provided to you when you use get_setup() or in the shiny application.
#' @inheritParams create_question_dictionary
